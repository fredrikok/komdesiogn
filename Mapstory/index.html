                I can just hear them now
                "How could you let us down?"
                But they don't know what I found
                Or see it from this way 'round
                Feeling it overtake
                All that I used to hate
                One by one, every trait
                I tried, but it's way too late
                All the signs I don't read
                Two sides of me can't agree
                Will I be in too deep?
                Going with what I always longed for
                [Chorus]
                Feel like a brand-new person
                But you'll make the same old mistakes
                Well, I don't care, I'm in love
                Stop before it's too late
                I knowâ€¦
                Feel like a brand-new person
                But you'll make the same old mistakes
                I finally know what it's like
                (You don't have what it takes)
                Stop before it's too late
                I know there's too much at stake
                Making the same mistakes
                And I still don't know why it's happening
                Stop while it's not too late
                And I still don't knowâ€¦
                
                [Verse 2]
                Finally taking flight
                I know you don't think it's right
                I know that you think it's fake
                Maybe fake's what I like
                The point is, I have the right
                Not thinkin' in black and white
                Thinkin' it's worth the fight
                Soon I'll be out of sight
                Knowing it all this time
                Going with what I always longed for

                Feel like a brand-new person
                But you'll make the same old mistakes
                So how do I know I've gone too far?
                (You don't have what it takes)
                Stop before it's too late
                
                [Bridge]
                Man, I know that it's hard to digest
                But maybe your story ain't so different from the rest
                And I know it seems wrong to accept
                But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
                Man, I know that it's hard to digest
                A realization is as good as a guess
                And I know it seems wrong to accept
                But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
                But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
                
                [Chorus]
                Feel like a brand-new person
                So, how will I know that it's right?
                In a new direction
                So, how will I know I've gone too far?
                Stop thinking that the only option wasâ€¦
                Feel like a brand-new person
                I finally know what it's like
                Stop thinking that the only option wasâ€¦
                In a new direction
                So how will I know I've gone too far?
                Stop thinking that the only option wasâ€¦
                And I know it's hard to describe
                Stop thinking that the only option wasâ€¦
                So how will I know that it's right?
