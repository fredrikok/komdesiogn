                Feel like a brand-new person
                But you'll make the same old mistakes
                Well, I don't care, I'm in love
                Stop before it's too late
                I knowâ€¦
                Feel like a brand-new person
                But you'll make the same old mistakes
                I finally know what it's like
                (You don't have what it takes)
                Stop before it's too late
                I know there's too much at stake
                Making the same mistakes
                And I still don't know why it's happening
                Stop while it's not too late
                And I still don't knowâ€¦

                I can just hear them now
                "How could you let us down?"
                But they don't know what I found
                Or see it from this way 'round
                Feeling it overtake
                All that I used to hate
                One by one, every trait
                I tried, but it's way too late
                All the signs I don't read
                Two sides of me can't agree
                Will I be in too deep?
                Going with what I always longed
